I do not remember a single human being I have killed. Flesh dies and that is the end. However... their feelings passed on and never fell to ruin and have even defeated me. I have witnessed that fact with my own eyes and I was so moved that I trembled".</p></td>

If humans didn't think like that, people with weak spirits couldn't keep going, right? I truly believe... that humans are pathetic".</p> </td>

Living in disgrace. Have I lived hundreds of years for this? Was I so afraid of defeat that I became a monster? Did I want to be strong even if it meant eating people? Did I become this miserable creature because I didn't want to die? No. Yoriichi... I just wanted to be you".</p></td>
