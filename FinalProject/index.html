                <h3>Creation</h3>
                <p> The Demon Slayer Corps is an organisation that was formed by the Ubuyashiki family sometime after Muzan Kibutsuji became a Demon during the heian period (794 to 1185). Muzan Kibutsuji is related to the Ubuyashiki family, so when he turned into a Demon their family was cursed and many died due to illness. The current head of the Ubuyashiki family went to see a priest who told them they would have to kill the Demon to be able to get rid of the curse. The Ubuyashiki family then dedicated their lives towards killing Muzan Kibutsuji and formed the Demon Slayer Corps. Although they are an organisation with a very long history they aren't officially recognised by the government. Their missions are always done covertly without the aid of other organizations outside of the Corps.</p>

The aim of Hashira Training is to improve all Demon Slayers' physical abilities and overall health, giving the members of the Demon Slayer Corps a better chance of winning the war against Demons. Each of the Hashira oversees a different part of the training program. Known training includes basic stamina training, flexibility training, quick movement training, sword skill training, pounding training, and muscle reinforcement training.</p>
